### Load packages

```{r load-packages, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse) 
library(datasauRus)
```


### Exercise 1

(Type your answer to Exercise 1 here. This exercise does not require any R code.)

The dataset has 1846 rows and 3 columns
The variables are x-values and y-values

### Exercise 2

(The answers for this Exercise are given for you below. But you should clean up some of the narrative so that it only includes what you want to turn in.)

First let's plot the data in the dino dataset:

```{r plot-dino, fig.height=3, fig.width=6}
dino_data <- datasaurus_dozen %>%
  filter(dataset == "dino")

ggplot(data = dino_data, mapping = aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_point()
```

And next calculate the correlation between `x` and `y` in this dataset:

```{r cor-dino}
dino_data %>%
  summarize(r = cor(x, y))
```

### Exercise 3

(Add code and narrative as needed. Note that the R chunks are labeled with `plot-star` and `cor-star` to provide spaces to place the code for plotting and calculating the correlation coefficient. To finish, clean up the narrative by removing these instructions.)


```{r plot-star, fig.height=3, fig.width=6}
star_data <- datasaurus_dozen %>%
  filter(dataset == "star")

ggplot(data = star_data, mapping = aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_point()
```

The correlation for the dino_data and star_data are around same level of association between x and y. In other words, the strenght of the association between x and y in both datasets(dino_data and star_data are similar)

```{r cor-star}
star_data %>%
  summarize(r = cor(x, y))
```

### Exercise 4

(Add code and narrative as needed. Note that two R chunks are given but they are not labeled. Use the convention from above to name them appropriately.)
Nice!
```{r plot-circle, fig.height=3, fig.width=6}
circle_data <- datasaurus_dozen %>%
  filter(dataset == "circle")

ggplot(data = circle_data, mapping = aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_point()
```

```{r cor-circle}
circle_data %>%
  summarize(r = cor(x, y))
```
The correlation of x and y of the circle_data when compared with the dino_data is about the same. No sharp difference

### Exercise 5

(Add code and narrative as needed. To add R chunks either type out the backticks, curly braces, and the letter `r` or use the Insert chunk button above, green C+.)

```{r}
ggplot(data = datasaurus_dozen, aes(x = x, y = y, color = dataset)) + geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~ dataset, ncol =3) +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```
```{r}
datasaurus_dozen %>%
group_by(dataset) %>%
  summarize(r = cor(x, y)) %>%
  print(13)

```
